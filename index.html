                    <h1>About XXX</h1>
                    <p>Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in Taiwan. It is also one of the top ten cancers in the United States. XXX is a game that would guide you through the methods of treating liver cancers and what you would need to consider when you are a liver cancer victim. While killing the cancer cells in XXX, you would also gain more knowledge of medicine and all sorts of therapies, especially ones that are targeted for liver cancers. </p>

                    <h1>About Me - Shiloh Liu</h1>
                    <p>My father is an interventional radiologist who does minimally-invasive image-guided procedures to diagnose and treat diseases. He is specialised in treating the abdomen, especially for liver cancers such as hepatitis. From a very young age, I am exposed to this kind of knowledge. I am also extremely interested in what my father is doing and after quite a long talk with my father, I decided to make XXX, combining my passion for biology and coding both. My goal is to let more people, including you, know more about liver cancer, its treatments, and the importance of making the right decision. </p>
